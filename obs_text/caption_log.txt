[2025-12-27 19:52:52] there was a truck that was chasing a white vehicle through the Sequoia Station parking lot. The vehicle has a flat tire. The driver got out and walked to the
[2025-12-27 19:52:57] other side of Barnes and Noble. It's unknown race male, unknown age. All she had was
[2025-12-27 19:53:01] scissoring a long jacket with baggy jeans.

[2025-12-27 20:03:51] Continuing on from Cleveland passing Lincoln.
[2025-12-27 20:04:06] Mean, Wong would be riding on the sidewalk until we confirm who he is, so we have something at least.
[2025-12-27 20:04:11] That's helpful.

[2025-12-27 20:12:02] small stature of female running as the patrol cars rolled up.
[2025-12-27 20:12:06] Towards southbound towards.
